  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A delicious Torta Ahogada filled with mouthwatering carnitas and drowned in a red chile and tomato sauce! It’s one of the best Mexican sandwiches you’ll ever eat!</p>
  <p>Tortas Ahogadas are the ultimate Mexican sandwich and are such a treat to eat!

    Stuffed with tender pork and smothered in a red chile and tomato sauce, they can be a little messy to handle but are so so worth it!
    
    Just grab a few extra napkins, an ice cold horchata or agua de tamarindo, and dig in!</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Bread</strong> – Tortas ahogadas are traditionally made with a bread called <em>birote</em> that’s crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. It’s similar to bolillo bread, but the outside is crunchier and has a saltier, almost sourdough-like flavor. Birote isn’t always easy to find in the U.S. so I recommend using a crusty bread like a French baguette or a sourdough. About a 6-8 inch size roll per person is great.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Carnitas</strong> – You’ll need 1 pound of cooked shredded pork carnitas. You can use the leftovers to make tacos and salad bowls!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Red Onions</strong> – Raw sliced red onions are great as well as <strong>pickled red onions</strong> to give the sandwich a little tanginess!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Tomatoes</strong> – Roma or plum tomatoes are used to make the base of the red sauce.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Chile de Arbol Peppers</strong> – These peppers are what give the sauce a spicy kick.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Garlic, Onions, Vinegar & Spices</strong> – Ground cumin, Mexican oregano, a splash of white vinegar and garlic and onions are all blended together with the tomatoes and peppers to make a tasty red chile sauce.

    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How To Make Tortas Ahogadas</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>First, you’ll need to make the sauce.</strong> Start by placing the dried chiles in boiling water until they softened. Then, roast the tomatoes under the broiler or over an open flame until the skins begin to blister and blacken.
      <p>
        Add the roasted tomatoes, softened chiles, and the remaining sauce ingredients to a blender and puree until smooth. Lightly cook the sauce in a saucepan with some olive oil until it starts to simmer. This will deepen the flavor of the sauce even more and cook out any strong raw onion flavors.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Next, assemble the sandwiches</strong> by stuffing each roll with a generous amount of carnitas and sliced onions. Place them bowls (a pasta bowl is great for this) or a plate with deep sides that can hold a good amount of liquid. Generously pour the sauce on top of each sandwich and enjoy!
