  <h2>Must Have Cooking Tools For This Recipe</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Ramekins</strong> – You’ll need durable dishes like ramekins to cook the jericalla in the oven.  The biggest advantages of ramekins are that they are affordable, can be baked, microwaved, frozen and put in the dishwasher without worry. And, they also make an elegant serving dish.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bain Marie Technique</strong> – To cook the jericalla in the oven, you’ll use the bain marie technique. This simply involves cooking the ramekins inside of a baking dish filled halfway with hot water.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Place milk, sugar and cinnamon, vanilla in a saucepan over medium heat
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir constantly for about 20 minutes. After everything has mixed well, turn off the heat and let it cool slightly for about 10 minutes. The liquid should be smooth.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until blended. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Then add eggs to the milk mixture mixture, stirring constantly
    </li>
    <li>
      Using a sieve or fork and remove the cinnamon pieces
    </li>
    <li>
      Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180C)
    </li>
    <li>
      Pour mixture equally among 6 ramekin pots or heat-resistant dessert dishes
    </li>
    <li>
      Place ramekin pots in a deep pyrex dish and add boiling water into the pyrex dish, taking care not to add water to ramekin pots.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fill the pyrex dish about halfway of the pots or about 1 inch (bain marie)
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake in oven for 35 minutes
    </li>
    <li>
      To check if it is ready, place a toothpick in the center of one of the ramekin pots. If it comes out clean, the jericalla is ready.
    </li>
    <li>
      Optional. To give the jericalla a burned effect, brown the ramekin pots under broiler for an extra 4 to 6 minutes or until tops are golden 
    </li>
