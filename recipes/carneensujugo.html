  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Carne en su jugo is a Guadalajara favorite. Small pieces of flank steak are cooked in their juices, then mixed with whole beans and crispy crumbled bacon. It makes me feel at home!
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>6 slices bacon</li>
    <li>3 cups water</li>
    <li>4 fresh tomatillos, husks removed</li>
    <li>3 serrano chile peppers, seeded and chopped</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, peeledli>
    <li>2 pounds flank steak, cut into 1/2-inch squares</li>
    <li>1 cube chicken bouillon</li>
    <li>2 (15.5 ounce) cans pinto beans</li>
    <li>Â½ onion, chopped</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>

    <li>1 lime, cut into 6 wedges</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How To Make Carne En Su Jugo</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble bacon and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      Combine water, tomatillos, serrano peppers, and garlic in a small saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Transfer contents to a blender; blend until smooth and set aside. (You can skip the simmering step and blend raw tomatillos, peppers, and garlic with water and a few pieces of browned flank steak if you like.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Place a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir flank steak in the hot skillet until completely browned. Pour tomatillo mixture over beef and bring to a boil. Stir in chicken bouillon and reduce heat to medium. Cover the skillet and simmer until tender, 30 minutes to 1 hour.
    </li>
    <li>
      Meanwhile, heat pinto beans in a saucepan over medium heat until warm; reduce heat to low to keep warm until needed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir bacon and pinto beans into flank steak mixture; divide mixture between 6 bowls. Garnish each with onion, cilantro, black pepper, and a lime wedge.
    </li>
  </ol>
